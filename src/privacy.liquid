    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <h2>
        Summary:
    </h2>
    <p>We respect the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this policy explains how we collect and treat
                any information you give us. You won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text.
                We’ve no desire to trick you into agreeing to something you might later regret.</p>

    <h2>Our policy covers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Why we value your privacy</li>
        <li>How we collect information</li>
        <li>What information we hold</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal and business
                information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies, governments, and other organisations keep
                on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for
                any reason other than why you gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.
    </p>
